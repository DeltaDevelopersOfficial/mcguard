# McGuard
- Minecraft server tool for better management

## Availability
- For this moment, McGuard is available only on windows.

## Can do
- Handle player join & quit server
- Handle incomming messages to chat
  - You can add custom commands starts with "!" (not visible for other in chat)

## Plans
- Add macro function (sequence of commands in text file)
   - Triggering will be using command !macro [filename]
   - When you run, the macrofile will be readed and command sent to server
     - You can use any of game command
     - You will be able to use TIMEOUT for sleep delay in these scripts.
     - May i will add variables, functions (like custom programming language)
<br>
- Add better security and bug/crash fixes
   - Fix all possible security holes (also under version 1.8)
   - Fix **slow server** world loading
   - Try to dispose **redstone** server lagging.
